Solving Sol
===========

![Sol LeWitt Reference Image](http://solvingsol.com/screenshots/thumbs/391-amiccolis-index.html.png)

An open project to implement Sol LeWitt's instructions in JavaScript.

[Sol LeWitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) was an American artist who is regarded as the founder of Conceptual and Minimal art.

A portion of his work were wall drawings for which he only provided instructions.

The instructions are simple and subtly open to interpretation. They're also good candidates to be executed programatically.


### Submitting a Solution (Pull Request)
To execute an instruction, please fork this repository and create a folder with your github user name within the folder of the instruction you're solving. (i.e. /118/github_user). 

The file should be executable in a modern web browser. Where possible, please load library scripts externally ([cdn.js](http://cdnjs.com/) is a good place to look.)

When you're done, add your solution to the JSON file `solutions.json` so we can easily generate the gallery of examples. If possible, include a screenshot of the result in the comment in the PR (but don't commit the screenshot). 

```
"In an interview, LeWitt was once asked, "How would you feel
if someone executed a wall drawing of yours without permission
but with care to follow the instructions and in an appropriate site?"
To which he replied, "OK... It would be authentic [and] it would
be a compliment."
```

### Example Instructions:

#### Wall Drawing #65 (1971)
Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.

#### Wall Drawing #97 (1971)
Within an 80 inch (200cm) square, 10,000 straight lines. Next to it is an 80 inch (200 cm) square with 10,000 not straight lines.

#### Wall Drawing #118 (1971)
On a wall surface, any continuous stretch of wall, using a hard pencil, place fifty points at random. The points should be evenly distributed over the area of the wall. All of the points should be connected by straight lines.
