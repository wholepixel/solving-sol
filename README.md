Solving Sol
===========

An open project to implement Sol LeWitt's instructions in JavaScript.

[Sol LeWitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) was an American artist who is regarded as the founder of Conceptual and Minimal art.

A portion of his work were wall drawings for which he only provided the instructions.

The instructions are simple and open to subtle interpretation.  They're also good candidates to be executed programatically.

To execute an instruction, please fork this repository and create a folder with your github user name within the folder of the instruction you're solving. (i.e. /118/github_user).

The file should be executable in a modern web browser. Where possible, please load library scripts externally ([cdn.js](http://cdnjs.com/) is a good place to look.)

We'll also consider pull requests containing links from [JSFiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/).

```
"In an interview, LeWitt was once asked, "How would you feel
if someone executed a wall drawing of yours without permission
but with care to follow the instructions and in an appropriate site?"
To which he replied, "OK... It would be authentic [and] it would
be a compliment."
```

### Example Instructions:

#### Wall Drawing #65 (1971)
Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.

#### Wall Drawing #97 (1971)
Within an 80 inch (200cm) square, 10,000 straight lines. Next to it is an 80 inch (200 cm) square with 10,000 not straight lines.

#### Wall Drawing #118 (1971)
On a wall surface, any continuous stretch of wall, using a hard pencil, place fifty points at random. The points should be evenly distributed over the area of the wall. All of the points should be connected by straight lines.
